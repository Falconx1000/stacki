# Stacki's first GraphQL API üçº

## Installation

You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to get started without a Stacki frontend.

## Getting Started

Once you have Docker installed, just enter `docker-compose up` in this directory. Docker compose will build the images and seed the database with a frontend and two backends. Then just open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`.

### Adding new types to the schema

New schema files must be added to the `app/schema` directory. If you are defining Query, Mutation, or Subscription types, they must be extended. A server restart is required when adding new schema files.

```grapqhl
extend type Query {
  newQuery: ReturnType
}

extend type Mutation {
  newMutation(newId: Int!): ReturnType
}

extend type Subsctiption {
  newSubscription(subId: Int!): ReturnType
}
```

### Adding new resolvers

New resolvers must be added to the `app/resolvers` directory. All resolvers must contain the following or the server will crash. We're working on this.

```python
from ariadne import ObjectType, QueryType, MutationType
import app.db as db

query = QueryType()
mutation = MutationType()
object_types = []
```

The server should restart by itself when updating resolver, but you may have to restart it yourself. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

## Progress

This is a very loose list of what has been accomplished.
